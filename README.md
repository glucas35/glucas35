Create a polished, professional website for a vineyard planning tool. The website should allow users to:

1. **Assess Property Potential**:
   - Questionnaire to gather information on grape types, rootstock, row and vine spacing, trellis type, growing style, and post types.
   - Based on input, provide recommendations and design possibilities.

2. **Vineyard Layout Tool**:
   - A drag-and-drop system to create vineyard layouts on a map.
   - Incorporate geography and slope data from the map to adjust design suggestions.

3. **Detailed Materials List**:
   - After layout design, generate a list with the number of vines, trellis posts, pencil rods, clips, gripples, trellis wire, and end post anchors needed.

4. **User Account System**:
   - Allow users to create accounts to save progress, store multiple vineyard layouts, and access past projects.
   - Vineyard managers and consultants should be able to refer back to saved designs.

5. **Educational Resources**:
   - Include tutorials, articles, videos on vineyard planning, grape growing, and viticulture.
   - A FAQ section to guide users in using the design tools.

6. **Professional Services Promotion**:
   - Allow vineyard consultants and vineyard management companies to promote their services in a tasteful manner to potential clients.

7. **Design & User Interface**:
   - Desktop-first design with a professional, easy-to-use interface that has a natural, organic feel, making users feel connected to the earth and their vineyard designs.
   - Mobile-friendly version with responsive design.

8. **Integrations**:
   - Payment gateway integration for consultations or premium features.
   - Social media sharing options.
   - Google Analytics or other tracking tools for performance insights.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Host the website on [preferred platform, e.g., Vercel, Netlify] and ensure scalability for future feature additions.
